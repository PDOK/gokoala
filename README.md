## Description

This server implements modern OGC APIs such as Common, Tiles, Styles, Features and GeoVolumes in a cloud-native way.
It contains a complete implementation of OGC API Features (part 1 and 2). With respect to OGC API Tiles, Styles, 
GeoVolumes the goal is to keep a narrow focus and not implement every aspect of these APIs. Meaning complex logic is 
delegated to other implementations. For example vector tile hosting may be delegated to a vector tile engine, 
3D tile hosting to object storage, raster map hosting to a WMS server, etc.

This application is deliberately not multi-tenant, it exposes an OGC API for _one_ dataset. Want to host multiple
datasets? Spin up a separate instance/container.

## Features

- [OGC API Common](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common/) serves landing page and conformance declaration. Also serves 
  OpenAPI specification and interactive Swagger UI. Multilingual support available.
- [OGC API Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) supports part 1 and part 2 of the spec. Serves features as HTML, GeoJSON or JSON-FG
  from GeoPackages in multiple projections. No on-the-fly re-projections are applied, separate GeoPackages should
  be configured ahead-of-time in each projection. Features can be served from local and/or
  [Cloud-Backed](https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) GeoPackages. Support for property and temporal filter(s) is available.
- [OGC API Tiles](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/tiles/) serves HTML, JSON and TileJSON metadata. Act as a proxy in front
  of a vector tiles engine (like Trex, Tegola, Martin) of your choosing. Currently, 3 
  projections (RD, ETRS89 and WebMercator) are supported.
- [OGC API Styles](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/styles/) serves HTML - including legends - 
  and JSON representation of supported (Mapbox) styles.
- [OGC API 3D GeoVolumes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/geovolumes/) serves HTML and JSON metadata and functions as a proxy
  in front of a [3D Tiles](https://www.ogc.org/standard/3dtiles/) server/storage of your choosing.
- [OGC API Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/) act as a passthrough proxy to an OGC API Processes
  implementation of your choosing, but enables the use of GoKoala's OGC API Common functionality.

   --enable-cors           enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) as required by OGC API specs. Disable if you handle CORS elsewhere. (default: false) [$ENABLE_CORS]
   --help, -h              show help
```

Example (config-file is mandatory):

```docker
docker run -v `pwd`/examples:/examples -p 8080:8080 -it pdok/gokoala --config-file /examples/config_vectortiles.yaml
```

Now open <http://localhost:8080>. See [examples](examples) for more details.

## Config

See the full **[Configuration Reference](./docs/README.md)** for available options.

The configuration YAML file consists of a general section and a section
per OGC API building block (tiles, styles, etc). See [example configuration
files](examples/) for details. You can reference environment variables in the
configuration file. For example to use the `MY_SERVER` env var:

```yaml
ogcApi:
  tiles:
    title: My Dataset
    tileServer: https://${MY_SERVER}/foo/bar
```

### OpenAPI spec

GoKoala ships with OGC OpenAPI support out of the box, see [OpenAPI
specs](engine/templates/openapi) for details. You can overwrite or extend
the defaults by providing your own spec using the `openapi-file` CLI flag.

### Observability

#### Health checks

Health endpoint is available on `/health`.

#### Profiling

Besides the main OGC server GoKoala can also start a debug server. This server
binds to localhost and a different port which you must specify using the
`--debug-port` flag. You shouldn't expose this port publicly but only access it
through a tunnel/port-forward. The debug server exposes `/debug` for use by
[pprof](https://go.dev/blog/pprof). For example with `--debug-port 9001`:

- Create a tunnel to the debug server e.g. in k8s: `kubectl port-forward
gokoala-75f59d57f4-4nd6q 9001:9001`
- Create CPU profile: `go tool pprof
http://localhost:9001/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=20`
- Start pprof visualization `go tool pprof -http=":8000" pprofbin <path to pb.gz
file>`
- Open <http://localhost:8000> to explore CPU flamegraphs and such.

A similar flow can be used to profile memory issues.

#### SQL query logging

Set `LOG_SQL=true` environment variable to enable logging of all SQL queries to stdout for debug purposes. 
Only applies to OGC API Features. Set e.g. `SLOW_QUERY_TIME=10s` to change the definition of a
slow query. Slow queries are always logged, unless they exceed the HTTP request timeout (which is currently 15s).

## Develop

Design principles:

- Performance and scalability are key!
- Be opinionated when you can, only make stuff configurable when you must.
- The `ogc` [package](internal/ogc/README.md) contains logic per specific OGC API
  building block.
- The `engine` package should contain general logic. `ogc` may reference
  `engine`.
  > :warning: The other way around is not allowed!
- Geospatial related configuration is done through the config file, technical
  configuration (host/port/etc) is done through CLI flags/env variables.
- Fail fast, fail hard: do as much pre-processing/validation on startup instead
  of during request handling.
- Assets/templates/etc should be explicitly included in the Docker image, see COPY
  commands in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
- Document your changes to [OGC OpenAPI example specs](engine/templates/openapi/README.md).

### Linting

Install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) and run `golangci-lint run`
from the root.

### Viewer

GoKoala includes a [viewer](viewer) which is available
as a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) for embedding in HTML pages. 
To use the viewer locally when running GoKoala outside Docker execute: `hack/build-local-viewer.sh`. This will 
build the viewer and add it to the GoKoala assets.

Note this is only required for local development. When running GoKoala as a container this is
already being taken care of when building the Docker container image.

### IntelliJ / GoLand

- Install the [Go Template](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10581-go-template) plugin
- Open `Preferences` > `Editor` > `File Types` select `Go Template files` and
  add the following file patterns:
  - `"*.go.html"`
  - `"*.go.json"`
  - `"*.go.tilejson"`
  - `"*.go.xml"`
- Now add template language support by running the
  [setup-jetbrains-gotemplates.sh](hack/setup-jetbrains-gotemplates.sh) script.
- Reopen the project (or restart IDE). Now you'll have full IDE support in the GoKoala templates.

Also:

- Set import order in `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Go` > `Imports`
  to `goimports` to align with VSCode and goimports usage in golangci-lint.

### VSCode

- Install the [Go Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jinliming2.vscode-go-template)
  extension
- Open Extension Settings and add the following file patterns:
  - `"*.go.html"`
  - `"*.go.json"`
  - `"*.go.tilejson"`
  - `"*.go.xml"`
- Also add `html`, `json` and `xml` to the list of Go template languages.
- Now you'll have IDE support in the GoKoala templates.

### OGC compliance validation
