## Description

This server implements modern [OGC APIs](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) such as Common, Tiles, Styles, Features and GeoVolumes 
in a cloud-native way. It contains a complete implementation of OGC API Features (part 1 and 2). With respect to 
OGC API Tiles, Styles, GeoVolumes the goal is to keep a narrow focus, meaning complex logic is delegated to other 
implementations. For example vector tile hosting may be delegated to a vector tile engine, 3D tile hosting to object storage, 
raster map hosting to a WMS server, etc.

This application is deliberately not multi-tenant, it exposes an OGC API for _one_ dataset. Want to host multiple
datasets? Spin up a separate instance/container.

## Features

- [OGC API Common](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common/) serves landing page and conformance declaration. Also serves 
  OpenAPI specification and interactive Swagger UI. Multilingual support available.
- [OGC API Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) supports part 1 and part 2 of the spec. 
  - Serves features as HTML, GeoJSON and JSON-FG
  - Support one or more GeoPackages as backing datastores. This can be local or [Cloud-Backed](https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) GeoPackages.
  - No on-the-fly reprojections are applied, separate GeoPackages should be configured ahead-of-time in each projection.
  - Supports property and temporal filtering.
  - Uses cursor-based pagination in order to support browsing large datasets.
  - Offers the ability to serve features representing "map sheets", allowing users to download a certain 
    geographic area in an arbitrary format like zip, gpkg, etc.
- [OGC API Tiles](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/tiles/) serves HTML, JSON and TileJSON metadata. Act as a proxy in front
  of a vector tiles server (like Trex, Tegola, Martin) or object storage of your choosing. 
  Currently, 3 projections (RD, ETRS89 and WebMercator) are supported.
- [OGC API Styles](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/styles/) serves HTML - including legends - 
  and JSON representation of supported (Mapbox) styles.
- [OGC API 3D GeoVolumes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/geovolumes/) serves HTML and JSON metadata and functions as a proxy
  in front of a [3D Tiles](https://www.ogc.org/standard/3dtiles/) server/storage of your choosing.

```

Now open <http://localhost:8080>. See [examples](examples) for more details.

## Config

See the full **[Configuration Reference](./docs/README.md)** for available options.

The configuration YAML file consists of a general section and a section
per OGC API building block (tiles, styles, etc). See [example configuration
files](examples/) for details. You can reference environment variables in the
configuration file. For example to use the `MY_SERVER` env var:

```yaml
ogcApi:
  tiles:
    title: My Dataset
    tileServer: https://${MY_SERVER}/foo/bar
```

### GeoPackage requirements

GoKoala has a few requirements regarding GeoPackages backing an OGC API Features:
- Each feature table must contain a [RTree](https://www.geopackage.org/guidance/extensions/rtree_spatial_indexes.html) index.
- Each feature table must contain a BTree spatial index:
```
select load_extension('/path/to/mod_spatialite');
alter table "<table>" add minx numeric;
alter table "<table>" add maxx numeric;
alter table "<table>" add miny numeric;
alter table "<table>" add maxy numeric;
update "<table>" set minx = st_minx('geom'), maxx = st_maxx('geom'), miny = st_miny('geom'), maxy = st_maxy('geom');
create index "<table>_spatial_idx" on "<table>"(fid, minx, maxx, miny, maxy);
```
- When enabling temporal filtering (using `datetime` query param) the temporal fields should be indexed and the spatial index should be expanded to include the temporal fields.
```
create index "<table>_spatial_idx" on "<table>"(fid, minx, maxx, miny, maxy, start_date, end_date);
create index "<table>_temporal_idx" on "<table>"(start_date, end_date);
```
- Each column used for property filtering should have an index, unless `indexRequired: false` is specified in the config.
- Feature IDs (fid) in the GeoPackage should be contiguous and auto-incrementing.

This is in addition to some of the requirements set forth by the PDOK [GeoPackage validator](https://github.com/PDOK/geopackage-validator).
Some of the requirements stated above can be automatically applied with help of the PDOK [GeoPackage optimizer](https://github.com/PDOK/geopackage-optimizer-go).

When using [Cloud-Backed](https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) GeoPackages we recommend a local cache that is able to hold the spatial index, see by `maxSize` in the config.

### OpenAPI spec

GoKoala ships with OGC OpenAPI support out of the box, see [OpenAPI
specs](engine/templates/openapi) for details. You can overwrite or extend
the defaults by providing your own spec using the `openapi-file` CLI flag.

### Observability

#### Health checks

Health endpoint is available on `/health`.

#### Profiling

Besides the main OGC server GoKoala can also start a debug server. This server
binds to localhost and a different port which you must specify using the
`--debug-port` flag. You shouldn't expose this port publicly but only access it
through a tunnel/port-forward. The debug server exposes `/debug` for use by
[pprof](https://go.dev/blog/pprof). For example with `--debug-port 9001`:

- Create a tunnel to the debug server e.g. in k8s: `kubectl port-forward
gokoala-75f59d57f4-4nd6q 9001:9001`
- Create CPU profile: `go tool pprof
http://localhost:9001/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=20`
- Start pprof visualization `go tool pprof -http=":8000" pprofbin <path to pb.gz
file>`
- Open <http://localhost:8000> to explore CPU flamegraphs and such.

A similar flow can be used to profile memory issues.

#### SQL query logging

Set `LOG_SQL=true` environment variable to enable logging of all SQL queries to stdout for debug purposes. 
Only applies to OGC API Features. Set e.g. `SLOW_QUERY_TIME=10s` to change the definition of a
slow query. Slow queries are always logged, unless they exceed the request timeout (which is currently 15s).

## Develop

Design principles:

- Performance and scalability are key!
- Be opinionated when you can, only make stuff configurable when you must.
- The `ogc` [package](internal/ogc/README.md) contains logic per specific OGC API
  building block.
- The `engine` package should contain general logic. `ogc` may reference
  `engine`.
  > :warning: The other way around is not allowed!
- Geospatial related configuration is done through the config file, technical
  configuration (host/port/etc) is done through CLI flags/env variables.
- Fail fast, fail hard: do as much pre-processing/validation on startup instead
  of during request handling.
- Assets/templates/etc should be explicitly included in the Docker image, see COPY
  commands in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
- Document your changes to [OGC OpenAPI example specs](engine/templates/openapi/README.md).

### Build/run as Go application

Make sure [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index), `openssl` and `curl` are installed. 
Also make sure `gcc` or similar is available since the application uses cgo.

```
go build -o gokoala cmd/main.go
./gokoala
```

To troubleshoot, review the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) since compilation also happens there.
Optionally set `SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/spatialite` when SpatiaLite isn't found.

### Linting

Install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) and run `golangci-lint run`
from the root.

### Viewer

GoKoala includes a [viewer](viewer) which is available
as a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) for embedding in HTML pages. 
To use the viewer locally when running GoKoala outside Docker execute: `hack/build-local-viewer.sh`. This will 
build the viewer and add it to the GoKoala assets.

Note this is only required for local development. When running GoKoala as a container this is
already being taken care of when building the Docker container image.

### IntelliJ / GoLand

- Install the [Go Template](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10581-go-template) plugin
- Open `Preferences` > `Editor` > `File Types` select `Go Template files` and
  add the following file patterns:
  - `"*.go.html"`
  - `"*.go.json"`
  - `"*.go.tilejson"`
  - `"*.go.xml"`
- Now add template language support by running the
  [setup-jetbrains-gotemplates.sh](hack/setup-jetbrains-gotemplates.sh) script.
- Reopen the project (or restart IDE). Now you'll have full IDE support in the GoKoala templates.

Also:

- Set import order in `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Go` > `Imports`
  to `goimports` to align with VSCode and goimports usage in golangci-lint.

### VSCode

- Install the [Go Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jinliming2.vscode-go-template)
  extension
- Open Extension Settings and add the following file patterns:
  - `"*.go.html"`
  - `"*.go.json"`
  - `"*.go.tilejson"`
  - `"*.go.xml"`
- Also add `html`, `json` and `xml` to the list of Go template languages.
- Now you'll have IDE support in the GoKoala templates.
