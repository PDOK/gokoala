FeaturesExplanation: GeoJSON is an open and widely accepted format for feature data and the first choice for many (web) applications. However, it formally only supports the WGS84 projection. JSON-FG is an extension of GeoJSON and does offer official support for other projections. Since JSON-FG is a recent development, from a compatibility point of view GeoJSON is also offered in other projections for the time being.
