[fake-addresses-crs84.gpkg](fake-addresses-crs84.gpkg) is derived from `internal/etl/testdata/addresses-crs84.gpkg` 
but heavily modified to support all sorts of test cases. Especially the street/place fields are modified. 
The geom field does not necessarily reflect the actual place/street. Just consider this data to be 
fake/fabricated for the sake of testing. 

=> Feel free to add additional records to implement new test cases!
