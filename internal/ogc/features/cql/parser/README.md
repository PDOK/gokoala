# CQL Text Parser

This package contains a parser for [OGC Common Query Language (CQL2)](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-065r2/21-065r2.html). 
Specifically, OGC CQL2 Text. The parser can be generated by running `go generate` and uses the [ANTLR4](https://antlr.org) parser
generator via the [generate-cql-parser.sh](hack/generate-cql-parser.sh) script.

The grammar is located in the `CqlLexer.g4` and `CqlParser.g4` files. These files are derived from
the https://github.com/ldproxy/xtraplatform-spatial repository, which is licensed under MPL 2.0.
All other files are generated by ANTLR4.
